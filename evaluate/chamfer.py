        norm: int indicates the norm used for the distance. Supports 1 for L1 and 2 for L2.
        single_directional: If False (default), loss comes from both the distance between
            each point in x and its nearest neighbor in y and each point in y and its nearest
            neighbor in x. If True, loss is the distance between each point in x and its

            If True (default), loss_normals is from one minus the absolute value of the
            cosine similarity, which means that exactly opposite normals are considered
            equivalent to exactly matching normals, i.e. sign does not matter.
